## 1. OrchestratorX
_Work under progress..._

**OrchestratorX** is a robust, distributed task management and automation platform designed to efficiently coordinate and control a network of agents. It allows administrators to securely execute commands, run scripts , and gather information from targeted servers or agents in real-time. Leveraging **Python, Flask, Socket Programming**, and **JWT for secure, token-based authentication, OrchestratorX ensures secure communication over HTTPS using SSL/TLS encryption**.

To manage and distribute tasks efficiently, OrchestratorX integrates with RabbitMQ, a powerful message broker that provides advanced queuing mechanisms, load balancing, and fault tolerance. This integration enables dynamic task distribution, retry handling, and asynchronous processing, ensuring that tasks are delivered and executed seamlessly across agents.

With an intuitive web interface, users can monitor agent health, view active connections, and assign tasks dynamically, making OrchestratorX an essential tool for managing and automating distributed systems at scale.
